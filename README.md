# LiveRetro

Let's make having retro's easy but most importantly environmently friendly.

Have retro's online so remote workers can join in with the sticky note fun without actually using sticky notes.

# Starting Guide
This project contains two seperate repositories. This one and https://github.com/Yoosh94/LiveRetro.UI
This project contains the code for a backend node server. The UI project is a react application. 

### Prerequisite
Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Understanding of Socket.io - https://socket.io/

### Node Server and React frontend
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project (my preferred editor is vscode)
3. Open a terminal (this can be inside vscode or your operating systems terminal and run _npm install_
4. Run _npm start_

Depending which project you complete these steps on, it will either start the node server which will be listening on post 5000 or it will start the react app (It will automatically open a browser on localhost:3000)

# Development Guide

If you have both the server and react app running locally, any code changes you make to the react app will automatically reload for you, however any changes on the server code will require you to stop the server on your terminal and start it again (npm start)
